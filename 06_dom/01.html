<!-- javascript html dom(document object model) -->
<!-- The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects: -->

<!-- With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

    JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
    JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
    JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
    JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
    JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
    JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
    JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page -->

    <!-- What is the DOM?

    The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.
    
    The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:
    
    "The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs
     and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."
    
    The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:
    
        Core DOM - standard model for all document types
        XML DOM - standard model for XML documents
        HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents -->

<!-- 
        What is the HTML DOM?

        The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:
        
            The HTML elements as objects
            The properties of all HTML elements
            The methods to access all HTML elements
            The events for all HTML elements
        
        In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.
